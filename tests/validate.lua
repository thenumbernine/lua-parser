-- This is due to my own luajit compiling with 5.2 compat...
-- But this begs the question, are there any flags testable when compiling luajit with LUAJIT_ENABLE_LUA52COMPAT ?

-- Seems you can test 'goto' for this
-- But load vs loadstring ... in 5.1 load() expects a function and loadstring() expects a string
-- While in 5.2 (or luajit + 5.2 compat?) load() accepts strings as well.
-- Which means I'll have to use loadstring() in the validation test ...
-- Mind you in Lua 5.3 that loadstring() no longer exists and this will produce an error.
if version == '5.1' then
	--[[
	if not pcall(loadstring'local goto=1') then
		version = '5.2'
	end
	--]]
	-- but then again, when it comes to luajit, the first test passes/fails between 2.0.5 and 2.1.0-beta3 (I think with/without LUAJIT_ENABLE_LUA52COMPAT...)
	-- but ::a:: goto a works in both my versions of LuaJIT.
	-- so instead I'll just upgrade all luajit versions:
	-- [[
	if jit then version = '5.2' end
	--]]
	-- but nevermind, both luajit 2.0.5 and 2.1.0 choke in weird places on the validate tests
